My implementation of the [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) scripting language written in Go.

Lox is a programming language designed by [Robert Nystrom](http://stuffwithstuff.com/) in the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

# Tests

The test suite in `test/official_tests` comes from the [original implementation](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test)
